Our function takes the parameters number of vertices (N) and list of captured edges(edges).
Then it creates a 2 dimensional array and marks all the played edges.
We use the double cross strategy to decide which edge to play.
In the double cross strategy we capture all but 2 boxes.
This forces the opponent to open the next set of boxes for us to capture.
